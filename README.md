## Java-Utilities-and-Tools

I have created the following tools:

1. **SetterGetterGenerator**: Using this tool we can create the setter and getter methods with writing a single line of code for the required methods.
2. **Keyboard** : This tools will neglect the use of Scanner class and performs the same functions for allowing programs for taking input.
3. **TMArrayList** :This tools is similar to the java collection class ArrayList and we can use this tool instead of java collection classes.
4. **TMLinkedList** :This tools is similar to the java collection class LinkedList and we can use this tool instead of java collection classes.
